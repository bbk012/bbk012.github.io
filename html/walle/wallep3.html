      <p> LPC2378 uC is a heart of the system. It controls all the peripherals which are either on the OLIMEX LPC2378-STK development board
          or on the additional self developed interface boards. There are 3 different NiNH battery packs which power the system one which is used to power
          motors, another one which is used to power servos and the third one which provides power to all electronics. PVG612 ICs (solid state relays) are used 
          to turn on and off power supply. This way LPC2378 uC has full power supply control and even can turn off and back turn on itself through its RTC Alarm output
          (as long as RTC battery is working). OLIMEX LPC2378-STK keypad (two buttons and joystick) is used to control LCD screen. Red LED on the STK board 
          is used as a heart bit indicator. MMA7260Q accelerometer which is available on the STK board is used as tilt detector to stop Wall-e when it starts to climb on obstacles.
          Left and right track motors are controlled by L298 IC motor driver. LPC2378 uC can control motor speed (PWM signal) as well as rotation direction (very standard L298 application).
          PVG612 IC is used to enable/disable motors' power. Because there is not encoder in the Tri-Track Chassis Kit I mounted internally a Transmissive Optical Sensor
          for both left and right track which counts track sprocket tooths passing through it. Powering of those sensors is also controlled (turned on or off) by uC.
          Dynamic buzzer KPX 612 05B is used to generate call signals. LPC2378 uC PWM outputs control head as well as left and right arm servos. Servos power supply
          same like in the case of other subsystem is fully controlled using solid state relay PVG612 ICs.
          8-channels Analog to Digital (A/D) converter MCP3208 on the main interface board is used to monitor every battery pack voltage level
          as well as to condition Angular Rate Sensor (ARS) EWTS62NB, front light phototransistor and day-light back photoresistor sensors. 
          Distance detector GP2D12 is also connected to this A/D converter and its power supply is fully controlled by the uC.
          HC-SR04 Ultrasonic (US) distance detector is connected to uC ports directly. EasyVR 3 the multi-purpose speech recognition module is connected to one of the LPC2378
          serial links. There is also another serial link used for remote RS-232 serial interface.

          <p> 
              Wall-e software has layer architecture. Source code file names have prefix corresponding to the particular layer to simplify code navigation.
              For example all operating system files both *.c and *.h have os_ prefix.
              The lowest layer is the one which is directly dealing with hardware denoted with hw_ prefix. Its functions directly manipulate particular hardware components.
              Upon that layer there is control layer denoted ctr_ which provides more abstract level access to the underlying devices.
              Operating system layer marked os_ provides all uC/OS-II real time kernel services like tasks, mutexes, queues etc.
              In order to use object oriented programming (OOP) there is additional C++ based wrapper created. In this way real time kernel services are made
              available through OOP mechanisms like inheritance etc. Because in the system there are some supportive real time tasks (which are not abstracted
              to the managers level) tsk_ layer is used to cover this. The key Wall-e real time communication and multitasking management is realized using
              publish/subscribe concept. This paradigm is implemented through publish subscribe middleware (denoted mw_) and managers (denoted mng_).
              In the publish/subscribe paradigm communicating entities are loosely coupled. Publishers do not know their subscribers they publish a notifier
              (message) which can be consume by none or many subscribers. This creates a lot of flexibility - adding additional subscriber for a particular
              notifier does not introduce any modification in the code of existing publishers and subscribers.
              In Wall-e system the highest level in the software are managers (independent tasks) which can be either a publisher or a subscribers or both.
              Managers are denoted with mng_ prefix. Notifier Dispatcher is driven by the highest priority tasks. It checks every publisher for any published notifier
              and delivers it to all subscribers. Subscribing can be dynamic at any moment subscriber can unsubscribe to receive any particular notifier.
              Notifiers are dynamically allocated on the heap, and reference count is used to keep them available as long as they are referenced.
              Publish/subscribe middleware is implemented using C++ templates. Because in the system standard C and C++ libraries are not used 
              (because of their size but also to have full control upon some functions like malloc, free etc.) there is system level
              library denoted lib_ which contains functions used by all other software components.
